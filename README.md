### My advent of code solutions (2025)

Merry xmas :D
Run `make` to build em.

## Day 1

This was pretty... interesting... I don't think I will stick to assembly for future, since it took me a lot longer to do this than anyone else.
If you ever find C hard... it feels EXTREMELY convinient compared to assembly.
Both `day1.elf` and `day1-part2.elf` read from `day1.txt`.
