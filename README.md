### My advent of code solutions (2025)

Merry xmas :D
Run `make` to build em.

## Day 1

This was pretty... interesting... I don't think I will stick to assembly for future, since it took me a lot longer to do this than anyone else.
If you ever find C hard... it feels EXTREMELY convinient compared to assembly.
Both `target/day1` and `target/day1-part2` read from `input/day1.txt`.

## Day 3
I skipped day 2. Go because I just wanted to focus on the challenge not the language this time.
