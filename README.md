### My advent of code solutions (2025)

Merry xmas :D

## Day 1

`make run-day1`/`make run-day1-part2`

This was pretty... interesting... I don't think I will stick to assembly for future, since it took me a lot longer to do this than anyone else.
If you ever find C hard... it feels EXTREMELY convinient compared to assembly.
Both `day1` and `day1-part2` read from `input/day1.txt`.

## Day 2

`make run-day2`

In orthodox kotlin anything goes as long as it works without kotlin runtime libs.
Oh, and it has to be built with a makefile (not any fancy new fangled thing like ant).

## Day 3

`make run-day3`/`make run-day3-part2`

~~I skipped day 2.~~ (I went back and did it now) Go because I just wanted to focus on the challenge not the language this time.
